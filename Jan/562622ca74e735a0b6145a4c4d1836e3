Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  Peter Navarro, a former top White House adviser, predicted that Donald Trump will be elected in “a landslide” during the next presidential election. While some Republican Trump critics have suggested that the former president’s political ambitions are done, others have argued that he is the GOP’s future. Trump has reportedly considered running again in 2024, while he has said that he plans to campaign for Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections. Navarro, who advised Trump on trade and manufacturing, made his prediction about 2024 during a Saturday interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. The former White House official made the remark as he criticized President Joe Biden for issuing a slew of executive orders during his first weeks in office. “Here’s the thing with these executive orders. It’s politics as usual,” Navarro said. “When Donald Trump gets elected in a landslide in 2024 he’s going to roll out the same kind of executive orders to roll things back. Newsweek reached out to Navarro and a Trump press representative for further comment, but did not immediately receive a response. In his final speech as president on January 20, Trump suggested to a crowd of supporters at Joint Base Andrews that this wouldn’t be the end of his political ambitions. “We love you. We will be back in some form,” he said. Source
