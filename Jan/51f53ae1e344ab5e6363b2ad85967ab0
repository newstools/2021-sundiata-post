ABUJA (Sundiata Post) -Chief Moses Nnamani left his base in Abuja and returned to his community, Oruku in the Nkanu Local Government Area of Enugu State. His mission was to prepare for the traditional marriage rites of his daughter.While in his compound containing two duplexes he got strange visitors one afternoon. A group of young men came and he received them warmly. They told him that he was one of the few men in the community that they respect and demanded N2m from him.Nnamani told Sundiata Post he was surprised. His wife had been warning him about the young men who come and greet him whenever they (him and his family) were home. He said he never took his wife’s warning seriously but was now alarmed.He asked them what the N2m was for and they told him that they came to him gently out of courtesy and that they, in fact, kidnap people and such persons get missing.They eventually extorted a total of N800,000 from him at gunpoint. The money was collected twice (N400,000 each time) in January 2020.The gang was led by one Emmanuel Mba, who was said to be notorious in the community from childhood. Nnamani has run for his life. He dares not come back to his village any time soon as the gang has threatened to deal with him.Nnamani’s fate is what has befallen the people of Oruku.
