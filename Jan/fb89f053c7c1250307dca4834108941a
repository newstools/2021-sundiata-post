In her chat with Channels TV, Ahmed said a lot of government assets are currently moribund and provide little or no value to Nigerians in their current state. “There are some government assets that are dead that can be sold to the private sector to be reactivated and put to use for the benefit of Nigerians. So we are looking at different categories of government assets that government has not been able to manage, that are lying down and in some cases even completely rundown, to cede them off to the private sector.”she said She said the Bureau of Public Enterprises will in the first quarter of this year begin to coordinate with other arms of government on the asset sales.
