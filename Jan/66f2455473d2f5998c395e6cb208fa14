And new reports say he spent the rest of the evening ‘isolated and wallowing in self pity’ .According to the Washington Post, a  White House adviser said “everybody’s angry at everyone” inside the White House, with the President being upset because he thinks people aren’t defending him enough.“He’s in self-pity mode,” the source said.The view among many close to Trump is “his actions led to here, no one else,” adding, “he instigated a mob to charge on the Capitol building to stop decertification, he’s not going to find a lot of sympathetic Republicans.”During the last impeachment effort, Trump’s allies and Republicans publicly defended him and sent out talking points throughout the impeachment proceeding.But on Wednesday night, Trump was left alone at the White House, as he released a statement to Fox News denouncing further violence, followed by a five-minute video that struck a very different contrite tone than his first message following the attack on the Capitol last week.Also, there was no organized effort to send out talking points, unlike his first impeachment.Reports also say many White House staffers have left or resigned since the riots, including Trump’s once longtime confidante Hope Hicks.Another person close to the White House said “he’s been holed up in the residence, that’s never a good thing.“He’s by himself, not a lot of people to bounce ideas off of, whenever that happens he goes to his worst instincts. Now that Twitter isn’t available God only knows what the outlet will be,” the source said.Reports now say Trump might use his last period in power to world his last powers-  pardons, which could come as soon as soon as Thursday and will distract Americans from the current narrative.It is yet to be seen if Trump will carry out the extraordinary step of pardoning himself and his children.The reports adds that a person close to Trump believes it’s a bad idea for him to pardon himself and his kids especially in the wake of the riots, but that he wants to exercise what remaining power he has.
