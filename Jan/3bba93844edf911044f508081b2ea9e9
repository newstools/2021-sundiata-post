US President, Joe Biden has stated to his aides the do’s and don’ts of his administration.  He addressed his virtual tough-guy talk to nearly 1,000 appointees. Biden was earlier this week inaugurated as the 46th president of America, after defeating then President Donald Trump in the polls in November, 2020. The 78-year-old Democrat gave the nearly 1,000 appointees the stern warning following his inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, January 20. During the virtual ceremony in the White House’s State Dining Room, Biden said: “I’m not joking when I say this. If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone – I promise you I will fire you on the spot. “On the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts. Everybody, everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity. That’s been missing in a big way in the last four years. “Cathy’s gone through all your backgrounds, talked to me about you. I’m confident you have the capacity to do it.” “If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treating another colleague with disrespect, talking down to someone, I will fire you on the spot" – President Biden warns his incoming presidential appointees.🎥: CNN pic.twitter.com/Rz57AenszW A reporter has been scolded by US President, Donald Trump during an interview.
