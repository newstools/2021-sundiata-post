Seven children who were abducted from Kano and moved to Anambra have been rescued by the Kano State Government.  The state Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, disclosed this during an interview with BBC Hausa today January 11. He said a committee instituted by the Kano State Government to search for over a hundred missing children found seven of them in Anambra State during a mission to the state and neighbouring Enugu. He stated that pictures and videos of the children were taken and spread until some people claimed they were the biological parents of five of the children. The Commissioner, however, added that the government was working to verify the claims of the people noting that if found true it would hand over the children to them.
