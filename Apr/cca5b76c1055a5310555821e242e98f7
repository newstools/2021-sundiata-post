Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has praised security personnel for their swift response that thwarted the attempted kidnap of four students at the Plateau State University, Bokkos.  The attempted kidnap was said to have occurred on Monday night when gunmen stormed the off-campus student residences at Ndar Community near the University campus and attempted to kidnap four students. On receiving the distress call, officers of Operation Safe Haven, Operation Rainbow, Nigeria Police, University Security and Community Watch Group mobilised and went after the kidnappers who had taken four students. Afraid of possible capture, the criminals aborted their mission leading to the safe recovery of the students. Governor Lalong, who commended the security agencies for rising up to the occasion, directed the immediate establishment of a police post within the host community of the University in order to forestall any reoccurrence.
