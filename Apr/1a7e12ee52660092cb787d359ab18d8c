Politicians can avoid pitfalls in politics, when they listen to their followers.  This was made known on Wednesday in Benin, the Edo State capital by a former Special Adviser on Political Matters to ex-Edo Governor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Charles Idahosa.  Idahosa spoke at the launch of a book and video, titled: “The Fall of The Last Godfather,” presented by a media professional, Ogie Ogedegbe. Idahosa, a former Edo Commissioner for Information and Orentation in the administration of Chief Lucky Igbinedion, noted that the book and video were his contributions to enrich the nation’s political library and enhance Nigeria’s democratic development. He said: “The book is an advisory to political leaders on the need to listen to their followers and ignore the ego massaging of sycophants, who prefer their self interests. “Leaders must learn to listen to discomforting voices from the other side, especially from strong voices.” The ex-political adviser also stated that the book would advance knowledge.
