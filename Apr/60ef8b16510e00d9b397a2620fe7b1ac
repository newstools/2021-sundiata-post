Abuja (Sundiata Post) –   Three-time African champions Super Eagles will most likely be seeded for the 2021 AFCON draw on June 25. The Eagles were unbeaten as they won Group L with 14 points, while the second ticket in that group will be decided between Benin and Sierra Leone in June. Nigeria finished third at the last edition in Egypt two years ago and their past records in the competition will be used to seed them, which in turn will see them head one of the first round groups.
