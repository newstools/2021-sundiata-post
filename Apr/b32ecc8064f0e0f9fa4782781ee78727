Former Governor of Imo State and senator representing Abia North, Orji Uzor Kalu has alleged that there is an attempt at sabotaging the Buhari-led administration.  In an interview on Channels Television, the senator called on the Federal Government which he claimed is not responding as it should, to collaborate more with governors in tackling security challenges in the country. Orji Uzor Kalu said; “Anywhere you have no police to police the society, it means the society is failed because the major job of a government is to protect lives and properties of the citizens. Once that kind of aspect fails, we are in trouble. “I believe there is sabotage to the Presidency of Muhammadu Buhari. A lot of sabotage, things are on duty to sabotage him, the society. “The Federal Government should cooperate with the state governments. We have done well as a party in many areas but security is key and we need to address this issue, come together.” The senator also asked President Buhari to convene a security summit with the service chiefs, governors, selected ex-governors and former military personnel.
