Three policemen who reportedly extorted N153,000 from one Sheriff Adedigba, a student of Lagos State University (LASU), have been dismissed from service.  Inspector Sunday John, Sgt Jimoh Asimiya and Sgt Solomon Adedapo allegedly extorted Adedigba while he was travelling from Abeokuta to Lagos. Ogun State Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun ordered their immediate arrest and detention. Spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said the three men were promptly apprehended and the money recovered and returned to the LASU undergraduate. Abimbola said the three were arraigned at an Orderly Room trial and found guilty of corrupt practices, discreditable conduct and disobedience to lawful order. They were dismissed from the force to serve as a deterrent, Abimbola said, noting that the student praised the commissioner of police for the prompt response to the incident.
