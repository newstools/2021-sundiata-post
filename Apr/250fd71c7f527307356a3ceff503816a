In the video clip, the pastor prophecised that a man was possed by a strange spirit and requested that he should come out. The pastor was heard in the video allegedly containing ‘hate speech’ saying, “God hates sin, not sinners. “When the Bible says, ‘Do not judge so that you will not be judged’, it means we should hate sin, not the sinner because sinners can change. If you have killed a sinner by judging him, there will be no opportunity for change. “Sinners can be delivered. We should hate the act, not the people because our battle is not against flesh and blood but against the ‘spirit beings’ that cause all these acts.”  Source
