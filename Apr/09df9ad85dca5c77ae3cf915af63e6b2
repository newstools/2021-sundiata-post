Abuja –   The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has confirmed the killing of three officers, following an attack by gunmen at a checkpoint along the Port Harcourt-Owerri road, Ikwerre LGA of Rivers state. Joseph Attah, spokesman of customs, confirmed the death of the officers to TheCable on Sunday. “It’s unfortunate we lost three officers in the attack. That’s the hazard of the job,” he said. Gunmen attacked two checkpoints — one for the NCS and another manned by officers of the Joint Task Force — on Saturday night. Weapons of the security operatives were reportedly carted away by the gunmen during the attack. Nnamdi Omoni, police spokesman in Rivers, had earlier confirmed the attacks to TheCable, but said the command is yet to establish the number of people that died in the incident. Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, described the attacks as unwarranted and callous, saying there is no justification for the killings. “We condemn this heinous act, share the grief of the security agencies, and convey our sincere condolences,” the governor had said in a statement issued on Sunday. Wike also demanded the arrest of perpetrators of the attacks, noting that those involved will not go unpunished.
