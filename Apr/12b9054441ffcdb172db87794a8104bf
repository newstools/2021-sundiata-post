Oracle co-founder and billionaire, Larry Ellison, has acquired the latest pricy purchase, a beachfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, one of the stateâ€™s highest.  The home Ellison purchased is ornately designed. He purchased this Tuscan-style mansion from Gabe Hoffman, founder of Accipiter Capital Management, for $80 million or just a shave over its asking price of $79.5 million. At 15,514-square-feet, the seven-bedroom property with 11 bathrooms, a home theater, and a swimming pool has 520 feet of ocean frontage and is one of the few homes in Florida that allow for private helicopter landing. tech-billionaire-larry-ellison-buys-80-million-estate-in-palm-beach Located in Seminole Landing, itself a gated community, the estate has its own private gated entrance adding to the privacy and security of the property.
