Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, a former President of Nigeria has stated that the country has failed as a result of nepotism.  Speaking on Tuesday, April 6, at the Palace of the Emir of Bauchi during a one-day working visit to Bauchi state, Mr Jonathan said the problem is with Nigeria’s leadership style that puts family, friends, and acquaintances over merit, ability and capability to deliver. He said for someone to be appointed to an office or given a responsibility in Nigeria, they must know someone at the top. This, he said, has been drawing the country backwards, Tribune reports. “In Nigeria, we have this tradition where some people feel that some ministries are big and juicy and must be given to a special person or that you have to know someone before you give him a responsibility role or put him somewhere. It is not like that with me, it is not my way of doing things,” Goodluck Jonathan said.
