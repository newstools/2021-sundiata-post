In what will come across as a really stunning development, a female student of the University of Abuja caused a massive spectacle on campus after having her wedding ceremony.  The unidentified and newly wedded bride stormed the exam hall wearing her bridal gown accompanied by her husband. A video shared by blogger, Instablog9ja captures the moment the student arrived at campus with her wedded husband and how she got everyone in the exam hall talking as she became the centre of attention.
