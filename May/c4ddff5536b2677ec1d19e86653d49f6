Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has granted freedom to 123 prison inmates across the state.  Ganduje, who witnessed the release of the inmates from Goron Dutse Prison yesterday, said the gesture was in the spirit of the Eid-El Fitr celebration. He said the beneficiaries were selected based on the gravity of offences and signs of reformation while in prison. The governor said the decision to visit the prison was to show the inmates that the state government was aware of their existence and that they were also regarded as citizens of the state. Ganduje said the gesture was to complement the Federal Government’s efforts to further reduce congestion in the nation’s prisons. He advised the ex-inmates to change their attitudes to life and pray for peace and stability in Nigeria.  Source Kano  -  The Minister of Interior, retired Lt.-Gen.
