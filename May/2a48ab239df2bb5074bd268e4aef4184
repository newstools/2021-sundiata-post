THE President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the Senate President, Ahmad Lawal, were among prominent Nigerians who took turns on Thursday to express their condolences to the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, his family and members of his church over the death of his son, Pastor Dare Adeboye.  The 42-year-old Dare was the Assistant Pastor in charge of Region 35 (Youth) in Eket, Akwa Ibom State before his death.  The cleric was said to have died while in his sleep, just as the door to his room was reportedly forced open to access his remains. The RCCG, in a statement, confirmed the incident, adding that he died on Tuesday. The statement read in part, “Though shaken, our anchor remains Jesus Christ in whom we have the assurance that we will one day meet in a place where there is no pain. It is the wish of the family to be granted privacy at this moment and that prayers be offered on their behalf.” President Buhari, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President urged them to find comfort in the teaching of the Holy Scriptures that those who chose to serve God faithfully would see Him “as He is in eternity”. The statement was titled ‘President Buhari commiserates with Pastor Adeboye on death of son.’ It read in part, “President Muhammadu Buhari extends deepest sympathies to the family of Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, on the passing of his son, Pastor Dare Adeboye.” Lawan, Gbajabiamila mourn Also, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, in a statement on Thursday by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, said, “May God Almighty comfort the highly respected Pastor, his family and the entire members of his flock over this great loss and repose the soul of the deceased in eternal bliss.” In his condolence message to the cleric and church, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said it was painful for a father to lose his child at any point in time, noting that the younger Adeboye lived a life full of worship to the Lord and service to humanity. The Speaker, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, titled ‘Gbajabiamila commiserates with Pastor Adeboye over son’s death’, recalled how Dare took after his father in the work of God and rose to become one of the leading youth pastors in RCCG. Jonathan, Atiku, Saraki condole with Adeboye Also, former President Goodluck Jonathan, in his condolence message described Adeboye as a beloved clergyman and noted that the deceased lived a life worthy of emulation, even as he prayed to God to grant his soul eternal rest. Jonathan said in a statement, “Though I never knew Pastor Dare personally, I have had cause to meet his father, Pastor Adeboye, and it would seem that the apple did not fall far from the tree.” Former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, and a former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, sympathised with Pastor Adeboye over the death of his son. Atiku’s condolence message was contained in a post made on his Twitter handle, @Atiku. The message partly read, “I pray that God, in this trying time, will comfort and strengthen him and his family by God’s grace.” Nigerian tweeps mourn as Adeboye loses 42-year-old-sonSaraki also wrote via his Twitter handle, @bukolasaraki, “My family and I send our heartfelt condolences and prayers to @PastorEAAdeboye, his family and the entire @Rccghq community over the passing of Pastor Dare Adeboye.” RCCG’ll miss Pastor Dare’s wise counsel, says Sanwo-Olu In his condolence message to RCCG’s General Overseer, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, consoled the RCCG General Overseer and his wife, Pastor Folu Adeboye, on the death of their beloved son.
