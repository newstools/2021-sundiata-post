Due to the incessant killings and abductions in Benue state, Governor Samuel Ortom has urged residents to take up arms and defend themselves.  The governor made the call while speaking to journalists on Monday at Oyo State where he attended the Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ meeting. The governor urged people to stand against armed invaders in their communities, even if it meant taking up weapons. “I have told my people to defend themselves. You can’t sit down in your house for people to come from somewhere and kill you. “If you don’t have weapons required by the law, go to your neighbour and get one. Everybody in Benue, both men and women should defend themselves,” he said. According to Daily Trust, Ortom also expressed his anger concerning the fresh killings that were allegedly carried out by suspected armed herdsmen in the state. To this effect, Ortom further stressed that the people should stand against such criminality in the future.
