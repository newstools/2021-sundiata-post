The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has announced that only 60,000 pilgrims will be allowed to perform the 2021 (1442) Hajj from across the world. This was disclosed on Sunday in a tweet via @HaramainInfo. The breakdown shows that only 45,000 pilgrims will perform the Hajj from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 15,000 from within. People under the age of 18 and above 60 years won’t be eligible for Hajj,” according to Special Representative to the PM on Religious Harmony, Maulana Tahir Ashrafi. “Only 60,000 pilgrims in total for all countries to perform Hajj rituals for this year 2021 / 1442 45,000 pilgrims from outside KSA will be allocated and 15,000 from inside KSA. An entire 9 page document has been released with all the necessary information,” @HaramainInfo tweeted. Only 1,000 pilgrims from KSA performed a symbolic Hajj last year, a far cry from over two million Muslims that usually perform the religious ritual annually. The significant reduction is attributed to the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic.
