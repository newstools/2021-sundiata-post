The entire South East geo-political zone has been left out in the recent designation of four international airports in the country as “Special Economic Zones” despite having an international airport in Enugu.  On August 24th, 2019, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) shutdown the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu for major repairs. The authority said the action was aimed at resolving the safety and security concerns to flight operations. After 371 days of shutting down the airport, on August 30th, 2020, the airport was opened for operation by the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika after he confirmed the airport fit to commence operations.

These are Lagos, Kano, Abuja & Port Harcourt. Our roadmap working,” the Minister of Aviation wrote via his twitter account.
