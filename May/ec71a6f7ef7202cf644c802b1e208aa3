The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) challenging the academic qualification of the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki.  A panel of the apex court, in a judgment on Friday evening, held that the appellants – APC and one of its chieftains, Edobor Williams – failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt, TheNation reports.
