Lagos State government yesterday unfolded plans to further regulate the activities of commercial motorcyclists in a bid to enhance security in the state.  Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who decried the display of lawlessness and criminality by the Okada riders, said he would announce further changes to their operations in certain areas of the metropolis. The new measures, he said, followed pleas by Lagosians to the state government to take decisive actions on some trends that have posed insecurity to the state. Many people have demanded action to curb the menace of commercial motorcycles, kidnapping, armed robbery, cult clashes and violent assault. It was at a stakeholders’ meeting on Security held at the Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja where the governor and leading lights in security circles listened to a group of panelists who highlighted the state’s security challenges. In the audience were religious leaders, the Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, military chiefs, traditional leaders, community leaders, students, unionists and members of the State Executive Council. Sanwo-Olu listed his administration’s efforts in security and assured his audience that a decisive action would be taken on commercial motorcycles, which speaker after speaker described as a getaway means for criminals. Its operators, they said, are unruly, uncouth, rude and brutal. But those who patronise them and the motorcyclists will not be left in the cold. The government, Sanwo-Olu said, will be inaugurating next week the first and last mile buses, which will ply the routes the motorcycles are plying. Besides, those who have taken up Okada riding for lack of jobs to grab the opportunities in agriculture, wealth creation, poverty alleviation and other government programmes. Sanwo-Olu said the meeting was convened in response to the growing threat posed by their lawless activities to the safety and security of lives in the state. The governor said the string of lawlessness daily witnessed from the confrontation between commercial motorcyclists and law enforcement agencies required an urgent action, stressing that government would be announcing reforms in transportation, which will further make changes to the parameters of motorcycle and tricycle operators. He said: “We have noted with dismay the fact that Okada riders are disregarding and flouting the restrictions we imposed on their activities in certain areas of the metropolis. We have also observed with dismay, the ongoing violent confrontation by commercial motorcyclists against our law enforcement agencies. “Based on all that we have seen and experienced in the past couple of weeks, as well as the increasing threat posed by the activities of commercial motorcycle operators to the safety and security of lives, we will be announcing further changes to the parameters of motorcycle and tricycle operations in the state in the coming days. No society can make progress amid such haughty display of lawlessness and criminality.” Sanwo-Olu said the state government would be unveiling 500 units of First and Last Mile mini buses next week as safer alternative means of transportation in checkmating activities of Okada riders. The governor also government would fully implement the state’s Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law of 2019 as amended, which will enable it take over and demolish abandoned buildings and construction sites turned into safe haven for hoodlums and miscreants. He added that the state would strengthen its clean-up exercise of shanties and spots unapproved for settlement, but which had turned to hideouts for criminals. The government, Sanwo-Olu said, would be recruiting more personnel into the Lagos State Neighbourhood Corps (LSNC) to boost intelligence gathering at the community level. The governor said the consultative meeting with the stakeholders was necessary to make security strategy effective and sustainable, noting that all hands must be on deck to work with the government in collecting, sharing and evaluating credible intelligence that would strengthen security of lives and property in Lagos. He said: “Lagos must continue to enjoy an atmosphere of peace, safety and all-encompassing security. We are determined to arrest the current security challenges being faced in the state, and we will take every step necessary to deliver on our promises on a safe, secure and livable state. We will also continue to communicate regularly with key stakeholders, and all the residents for updates on the progress we are making.” Appraising security situation in Lagos, Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, raised the alarm over rising security breaches resulting from the menace of Okada operations. Between January and early this month, Odumosu disclosed, 320 commercial motorcycles were arrested in 218 cases of criminal incidents in which 78 suspects were detained and 480 ammunition recovered. In the same period, the Lagos police boss said Okada accounted for 83 per cent of 385 cases of avoidable fatal vehicular accidents in Lagos. He said: “The menace of Okada operators does not end with avoidable accidents. Crime reports from the field have shown that a greater percentage of crimes, ranging from armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, murder, burglary and stealing, traffic robbery to carjacking and cash snatching from bank customers, are attributable to armed hoodlums who operate on Okada. “The nuisance constituted by the Okada operators on Lagos roads has become a danger to law-abiding citizens. Sections of Lagos populace have come to regard commercial motorcycles as a necessary evil, it has become imperative for government to take more drastic measures against their notoriety.” “The State Police Command strongly advises the state government to immediately review the current guidelines guiding the operation of Okada as a means of commercial transportation in the state and take decisive legal and administrative steps and policies that will curb their traffic, criminal and other nefarious activities in the state.” There was a panel of discussion chaired by an award-winning Television Show host, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, in which residents aired their views on the current state of security in Lagos and across the country. The discussants expressed concerns on the security implications of allowing operations of Okada and demanded a ‘Special Status’ for Lagos as ethnic melting pot. They also urged the government to create economic opportunities and vocational engagement for unemployed residents to further lessen crime rates. Addressing the complaints about criminals hiding in uncompleted buildings and abandoned vehicles within communities, Vice Chairman of Lagos State Community Development Advisory Council, Mr. Rotimi Ayoku-Owolawi, said the CDC was ready to support the government and the police in identifying dark spots and lock-up markets from where criminals launch their nefarious activities. Commissioner for Information Mr. Gbenga Omotoso described the stakeholders’ engagement as proactive, given a string of security breaches in the country. He said gone were the days when citizens were at the mercy of pick-pockets and amateur criminals. The contemporary crimes, he said, are being committed by armed robbers, blood-sucking bandits and dare-devil gangsters. “We don’t want our Lagos to become an epicenter of evil and criminality,” Omotoso said. At the end of the stakeholders’ meeting, a 12-point resolution was reached and agreed upon by the participants in public interest. The resolution reads in part: “Attacks on law enforcement officers and agencies should not be handled with kid gloves. Culprits must be arrested and the full weight of the law brought to bear on such persons. “The government must take stringent measures to ban the use of Okada as means of transportation in the state; alternatives must be provided by the state government in agriculture, wealth creation, women empowerment programmes and others. “Government should take control of abandoned and uncompleted buildings used as hideouts of criminals in the state immediately. The state must take control of abandoned vehicles in its nooks and crannies and seal off houses, hotels and event centres where hoodlums are found to hibernate or where arms are stored.”  Source Lagos In Talks With COVID-19 Vaccine Manufacturers — Sanwo-OluChannels TelevisionUpdated January 25, 2021 Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Sunday said his government was in touch with manufacturers of the COVID-19 vaccine.
