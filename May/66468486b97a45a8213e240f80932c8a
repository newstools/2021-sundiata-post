Abuja – Leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has claimed that he foresaw the activities of Fulani herdsmen which has recently plunged the entire nation into an unusual security crisis. Kanu said he spoke with a session of Nigerians in the United States in 2015 that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration would usher herdsmen and farmers’ crisis. The IPOB leader stated this while reacting to a report that some schools in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT Abuja were shutting down following the alleged influx of Fulani militias into some parts of Niger State, near the nation’s capital. In a tweet on his official Twitter handle, Kanu lamented how his warning was ignored. “In 2015 I warned the leadership of World Igbo Congress (WIC) in USA & #Nigerians at large during a town hall meeting in LA that @MBuhari’s reign will usher in a deadly and devastating armed Fulani invasion of the country. “But they ignored my prophecy. Today they have come”, he tweeted.  •IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu By Pamela Eboh AWKA - Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has spoken on his recent interaction with the United Nations, disclosing that he presented issues concerning the agitation for the sovereign state of Biafra during a series of meetings he… In "Top Stories" - Nnamdi Kanu today July 24 visited Ebonyi state - The IPOB leader was massively received in the state - Radio Biafra however said Nigeria federal government will be held responsible should anything happens to Nnamdi Kanu during his visit to the state - Nnamdi Kanu however had to trek… In "Top Stories" •Nnamdi Kanu Any student of Igbo folklore knows  too well not to dance to the spooky tunes of Surugede.
