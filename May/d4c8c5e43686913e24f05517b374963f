BERLIN – Ansu Fati’s injury comeback has hit another setback, with FC Barcelona confirming the Spain forward has had to undergo another knee operation. Fati suffered a serious meniscus injury in November, having scored five goals across 10 appearances for Barca in all competitions. He had initially been forecast to return in March. But the 18-year-old hinted in a social media post at the end of that month he may be facing a longer spell on the sidelines. Having failed to return to training throughout April, Fati has now gone under the knife yet again, this time for a revision arthroscopy in his left knee. Barca confirmed in a statement on the club’s official website that the operation had been undertaken by Dr. Jose Carlos Noronha in Porto. The Blaugrana have offered no update on a timescale for Fati’s return. But it will certainly rule the youngster out of Euro 2020, albeit his chances of making the rearranged tournament already seemed extremely remote.(dpa/NAN) Barcelona (Spain) -  Lionel Messi was back in scoring business for FC Barcelona on Sunday, leading them to a resounding 4-0 win at home against Villarreal.
