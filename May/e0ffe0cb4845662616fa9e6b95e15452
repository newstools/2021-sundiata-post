We pray that God will keep his miraculous working power in your life and all those who needs a miracle today, will use you as a point of contact for their own in JESUS name. (Amen) love from Dad, Mom and the whole Adeboye dynasty.” Confirming the sad development, one of the top shots in the RCCG family said: “Shock. Disbelief. Tears. Thanksgiving. Praise.
