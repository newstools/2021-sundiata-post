According to The Telegraph, the head of the royal medical household and the physician to the Queen, Sir Huw Thomas, in his death certificate stated that what led to Philip’s demise was simply ‘old age’. According to the report, the description ‘old age’ is accepted if the patient is over 80 and if the doctor has personally cared for the patient for a long period, observing a gradual decline.
