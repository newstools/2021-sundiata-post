This however failed again, as it began raining almost immediately, leaving the king in a rage with guests and delegates in hot flight for shelter, “it said.According to the statement, the scene cut to another ceremony, and this time, the king sternly warned the rainmaker beforehand not to fail, having failed yet again, with heavy lightning and thunderstorm striking, the king ordered him to be seized by guardsmen.It said that in the final act, the rainmaker was seen building a huge shelter as punishment for his incompetence, while the satisfied king smiled on.Speaking at the launch, Emeka Oparah, Airtel Nigeria Director of Corporate Communications and CSR, said :“We are inspired by people and their stories and we love to tell compelling stories that connect with emotions and the heart.”Oparah said that Airtel was also inspired by the beautiful Nigerian culture and would continue to celebrate different cultures just as they have done with the rainmaker commercialAirtel Nigeria Vice President, Corporate Brands and Advertising, Tokunbo Adodo, said the commercial was hinged on Nigeria’s cultural diversity.It aims to celebrate the country’s rich cultural heritage and also communicate the essence of staying connected as a people, Adodo said.“Airtel is an incredibly consumer-centric brand and this commercial is about what drives our customers.
