According to PREMIUM TIMES, Abiodun Abdul-Balogun, The Ogun State Commissioner for Environment who was accused of attempted rape by a teenager in January has secretly resigned his appointment from government.  Abiodun Abdul-Balogun has also coerced the family of the victims not to testify against him in court, an action that has stopped police and the stateâ€™s department of public prosecutions from proceeding with the matter, sources said. The accused did not deny when our correspondent confronted him with our findings. He simply pleaded that the matter be laid to rest. How it started A 16-year old secondary school student, Barakat Melojuekun, accused Mr Abdul-Balogun, of attempting to rape her in his residence on December 31, 2020. She alleged that the commissioner fondled her breasts while reciting incantations, apparently to scare her. She also said her screams forced Mr Abdul-Balogun to jump off her and offer her N2,000 to shut up. Mr Abdul-Balogun had offered her a lift, lobbied to get her telephone number, and promised to get her a job as a computer operator. Rather than getting the job, she claimed she was molested. The teenager said she reported the case to her parents who escalated it to the police. As expected, the police on January 1, 2021, invited the commissioner to Abigi Police Station for interrogation. During this period, the only defence Mr Abdul-Balogun pulled was that he was being set up by his political opponents.The allegations against the commissioner elicited outrage on social media and many Nigerians called for his removal from office and prosecution.
