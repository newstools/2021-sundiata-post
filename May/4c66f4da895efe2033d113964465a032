According to Eddie Hearn, the boxing match between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury will take place in a purpose-built stadium in Saudi Arabia.  This comes days after the boxing promoter confirmed the fight will take place in Saudi Arabia on August 14.  Hearn has shared more updates on the upcoming fight, revealing that plans are in place for an entirely new venue to stage the fight for the undisputed heavyweight title. Discussing the venue, Hearn told Sky Sports about the hosts in Saudi Arabia: “They want to build a new stadium. They have indoors options. “In August at 11pm it will be about 23 degrees. “They want to create something very, very special. Last time they built a stadium for the Andy Ruiz Jr fight in just seven weeks and it held 18,000. “This will be a similar set-up. Tyson Fury recently took aim at trio Heavy Weights from different fields on his official social media page. In his rant, he took aim at Anthony Joshua as he mocked him while daring him to make the fight happen, as he promised to smash Joshua’s face. While I’m on a rant. I may as well call out one more person,” he said “A big, useless dosser. Not a real fighting man. A hype job. Bodybuild(er), crossfit, big, ugly s***house. “AJ, if you’re out there, let’s make this fight happen, you big dosser. You big s***house bum dosser. “I’m gonna smash your face in, too, and there’s not one thing you can do about it.” He added.   Source
