The driver of the Vectra car was still unconscious when I left the hospital.” State Deputy Chairman of the PDP, Bitrus Golen, who survived the auto crash also confirmed the incident, saying their survival was a miracle He said, “It was the driver of the Vectra car who caused the accident. We were told that he is a mechanic on the road to test a car that he had repaired for the owner. And the owner who was with him in the car was even telling the mechanic to lower his speed before he suddenly hit our bus. If not because our own driver did his best, the situation could have been worse but we thank God for everything.” The State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, John Akans, who expressed shock at the unfortunate incident said the party had cancelled the PDP tour scheduled for the Central Zone on Tuesday in honour of the deceased party official and those who sustained injuries during the accident . “Considering what happened and in the wisdom of our leaders, we have decided to put off our party’s tour scheduled to continue today (Tuesday) for the Plateau central zone,” he added.
