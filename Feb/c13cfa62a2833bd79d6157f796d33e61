British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, on Wednesday, joined the #BeLikeNgoziChallenge which has been trending online since the beginning of the week. The #BeLikeNgoziChallenge challenge has attracted sizzling attention lately with the historic emergence of Nigeria’s pride, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. The Nigerian development economist, known for her African print Ankara wears and peculiar headgear usually tilted at a convenient angle, said in a recent interview that she unabashedly “love being African and being Nigerian”. The #BeLikeNgoziChallenge challenge involves social media users dressing up like Okonjo-Iweala. Temie Giwa-Tubosun of Lifebank, a platform that delivers medical supplies.
