ABUJA – National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Saturday, partook in the ongoing membership registration and revalidation exercise of the ruling party. Surrounded by some of his men, including Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Tinubu posed for photographs at the end of the exercise. Gboyega Akosile, media aide of Sanwo-Olu, later shared the pictures on social media and Daily Trust observed at least two errors on the form. While the known birthday of the APC leader is 28 March 1952 but 27/03/52 was filled on the form. Although yesterday’s date was 6 February 2021, 09/02/21 was recorded as the date when Tinubu registered.
