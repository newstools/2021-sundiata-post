Reality star, Khafi Kareem has cautioned womb watchers, asking them how difficult it is for them to leave women’s womb alone.  According to her, if someone has not publicly come out to say they are pregnant, people should stop insinuating that they are.  She noted that people should have some patience before they announce people’s pregnancy. She Wrote; ”People need to STOP this. If someone has not announced a pregnancy DO NOT congratulate them. DO NOT comment what you “think” you see! Whatever your intentions you don’t know what people are going through!!!” “If they have good news let THEM share it. Speculations can cause so much hurt and distress. Women could be trying unsuccessfully for a baby, just had a miscarriage, have fibroids etc or have simply put on weight. STOP the scrutiny. How hard is it to leave women’s’ wombs alone?!”
