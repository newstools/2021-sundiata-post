Original boss lady, TBoss has lambasted her fellow reality star, Ka3na for lashing out at a fan who drew a tattoo of the celebrity on her body.  The girl it was gathered is currently hospitalized after nearly killing herself. Ka3na had berated a fan who got a tattoo of her name inked on her skin for the sake of ‘fan love’. She had first begged on Twitter for fans to tattoo her face or name on her body. However, when a fan obliged, Ka3na instead of hailing her, decided to talk down on her.  This forced Nollywood actress, Ada Ameh to lampoon Ka3na, tagging her action as being wicked and stupid. Reacting also, Tboss advised Nigerians to be careful of who they make their role model to avoid being misled. Speaking further, she reclaimed her status as the original boss lady by counseling youngsters to know the difference between a “bus lady” and a “boss lady”.
