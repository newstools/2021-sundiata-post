Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, has lambasted Yekini Nabena, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, calling him an impostor and a pretender.  Mohammed made the remark in response to a statement credited to Nabena in the ongoing membership revalidation exercise of the APC in Kwara State. The minister had called for the cancellation of APC revalidation in Kwara State over alleged irregularities. Mohammed had said the revalidation exercise did not meet guidelines laid down by the national body of APC. However, Nabena countered the stance of the minister. Nabena charged Mohammed to submit to the authority of AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, the Kwara State Governor over matters of the party in the state. Reacting, Mohammed, in a statement he signed stressed that APC has no position of Deputy National Publicity Secretary, hence Nabena should be ignored. According to Mohammed: “My attention has been drawn to the statement credited to one Yekini Nabena, who was described as the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on the ongoing APC Membership Registration in Kwara State. “The said Nabena must have been speaking for himself, as the APC National Caretaker Committee, as presently constituted, has no position like that of Deputy National Publicity Secretary. “As things stand, therefore, anyone claiming to be the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC is an impostor, hence I will not dignify such a pretender with a response.”  Source
