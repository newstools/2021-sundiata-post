Some prominent Igbo leaders have stormed the National Assembly to demand for the creation of a new state in the South East. The Igbo leaders were led by Chief John Nwodo, former president-general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Wednesday, February 10. The Igbo leaders asked for the creation of another southeast state from Enugu. Nwodo met with all the key officials in the National Assembly to push for the new state which he called ‘Adada’ adding it was approved at the 2014 national conference. Responding to the demand during a meeting with the delegation, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said it is a legitimate agitation.
