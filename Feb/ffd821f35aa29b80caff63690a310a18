In a video making rounds online, a heavily pregnant Nigerian woman was spotted in the streets of Europe, dragging a man for allegedly impregnating her. Despite her strong conviction that he is the father of the unborn child, the man strongly denied. The yet-to-be-identified woman can be seen arguing with the young man in public that he is responsible for her pregnancy. Although he strongly denies the claim, his accuser doesn’t let go and promises not to free him till he admits to being responsible for the child. A third party present at the scene also chips in, advising the man to accept responsibility. He went on to threaten to call the police, as he claimed to have seen strange male trousers and underwear in his house, which is why he won’t be accepting the baby.
