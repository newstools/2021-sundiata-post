The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has expelled two of its former governorship aspirants, Mrs. Jumoke Anifowose and Dr. Nath Adojutelegan.  Jumoke is a daughter of first Executive Governor of the state, Pa Adekunle Ajasin. Both Anifowose and Adojutelegan lost in last year’s APC primaries to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the primaries, they dragged the party to court asking for an order to cancel the primaries. The Supreme Court last week threw out their suits for lacking in merit. Speaking at a press briefing in Akure, spokesman of the party, Alex Kalejaiye, said the former governorship aspirants were suspended for engaging in anti party activities. Kalejaiye said the party followed all laod down processes as spelt out in Article 21 of the APC constitution. He said the National leadership would be communicated on the expulsion of the two former APC chieftains.
