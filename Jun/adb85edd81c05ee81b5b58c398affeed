Former aide to erstwhile President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri has reacted to the story of a UNILAG student, Chidinma Adaora Ojukwu who reportedly killed her sugar daddy, Usifo Ataga, the Super TV boss. According to Omokri, Chidinma is a victim of circumstance. Omokri said that the young lady did what she allegedly did because her parents failed in carrying out their responsibility appropriately. Omokri noted that Chidinma is just 21 years old while Mr. Ataga was 50 years old. He went further to say that Chidinma could have been Mr. Ataga’s daughter because of the staggering age difference between the two lovers. Omokri however called on meaningful Nigerians to stop demonizing the young girl and look for ways of helping her out. Here is what he said, “Everybody is in a rush to demonise Chidinma. But it takes 2 to tango. She was 21. He was 50. A 29 year age gap. She could have been his daughter. How many of you condemning her were mature at 21? She erred. But is also a victim. Of bad parenting and a bad society”, he said. •Chidinma in her shop LAGOS- More details have emerged about Chidimma Ojukwu, the killer of Super TV CEO, Usifo Ataga.
