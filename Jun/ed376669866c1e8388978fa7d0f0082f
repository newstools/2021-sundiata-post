Harry Maguire is targeting a return, most likely as a substitute, in the final group game between England and the Czech Republic in 11 days’ time.  The Manchester United skipper is almost certain to miss England’s Sunday’s Euro 2020 clash against Croatia despite the defender’s return to full training.  He is resigned to missing the opening game and next Friday’s clash against Scotland. Maguire has been out of action since suffering an ankle ligament injury at Aston Villa on May 9, which forced him to miss United’s final five matches of the season, including the Europa League final penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal. Despite his fitness issues, Harry was selected in Gareth Southgate’s 26-man final squad for the tournament, which was confirmed last week. Meanwhile, England players have been left in the dark about how Southgate plans to set up his team against Croatia. Gareth Southgate is understood to have switched between playing three at the back and a conventional four-man defense at St George’s Park over the past 48 hours. Full back Luke Shaw has been looked at in a three-man central defense. But with just two training sessions before the clash against Croatia, Southgate’s plans are likely to become much clearer on Saturday  Source
