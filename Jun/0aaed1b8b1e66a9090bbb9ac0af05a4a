Two chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, Lauretta Onochie and Joe Igbokwe have been labeled slaves by the Biafra Nations League.  Onochie is President Mohammadu Buhari’s Social Media Personal Assistant. While Igbokwe is an appointee of Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Igbokwe had criticized Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe for rocking ‘Dot Nation’ T-shirt, describing him as an ethnic bigot. BNL accused both political aides “of collecting money to fight their kinsmen.” The group made the claim in reaction to Igbokwe’s comments on Abaribe’s “Dot Nation” T-shirt. However, BNL National Leader, Princewill Chimezie Richard said, “Igbokwe is doing everything possible to remain relevant in Lagos politics by fighting the interest of Igbos and the entire Biafra Nation.” In a statement he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Richard, however, likened the APC chieftain’s character to that of Onochie who he described as “a political harlot who ought to be in her husband’s kitchen but decided to be sharing Buhari’s kitchen with Aisha.” The BNL leader said the “two Igbo aides are enemies of the Southeast who will soon be dumped after they have been used.”  Source Only The Just Can Be Vindicated In "Opinion" … Says Greatest Tragedy is for Politician to Forget his Origin and Insult his Roots Because of Political Opportunism By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) - Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress Comrade Timi Frank has taken Mr Joe Igbokwe to the cleaners over his comments against… In "Top Stories" In his well published diatribe against the Igbo people of Nigeria, Joe Igbokwe, the Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Lagos State chapter, who is also a son of Igbo, poured invectives on the Igbo nation while making spurious allegations against them.
