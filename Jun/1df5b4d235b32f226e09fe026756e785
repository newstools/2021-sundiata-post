On Tuesday, June 15, he was making advances at me and I resisted, so he became violent and later had his way. “In the afternoon he ordered for smoke, ate and we became high because I also smoked with him even though I was still angry for the first one he did. “So, I was on my own, watching a movie on the couch. He came at me again and I said no because I wasn’t happy with him. “I told him that he doesn’t help me but only plays me around, he kept trying to make advances and I was resisting so I had to defend myself. “At some point, he hit my head on the wall and was choking me.
