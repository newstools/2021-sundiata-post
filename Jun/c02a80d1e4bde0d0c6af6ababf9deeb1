LAGOS – Popular Nigerian televangelist, Pastor Temitope Balogun (TB) Joshua, is dead. He reportedly died in Lagos on Saturday evening shortly after concluding a programme at his church, Synagogue Church of all Nations (SCOAN), located in the Ikotun Egbe area of Lagos, the Nigerian commercial capital. The megachurch runs the popular Emmanuel TV television station from Lagos. Multiple reports said the SCOAN Founder died last night, Saturday, June 5, 2021, after concluding a church programme. The reports said that his body has been deposited in an undisclosed Lagos mortuary. However, one of Joshua’s friends, former aviation minister, Femi Fani-Kayode debunked the report as fake news. He wrote on social media: “The story that is being peddled around by some fake news merchants that my dearest friend and brother, Prophet T.B. Joshua of SCOAN, is dead is FALSE! “It is FAKE NEWS in its most hideous form. The Prophet is alive and well and he shall live long and prosper. Glory hallelujah!” Joshua was born on June 12, 1963 in Arigidi-Akoko, in Ondo State. On 3 June in a Facebook post on his TB Joshua Ministries account, he told his followers he would not be able to mark his 58th birthday, saying in a special birthday message: “Happy Birthday to you! Viewers all over the world, June 12th is around the corner. As you know, I am a man of the people. So, the wound of one is the wound of all. “As things stand, you may have realised it will not be easy for me to celebrate my birthday under the present circumstances. Some of the people who want to come are troubled by the situation all over the world. We see their fear and their worry. I feel their pain; I feel their worry. “Therefore, let us dedicate this day to prayer and fasting. Don’t forget the needy. By the grace of God, more birthdays are ahead. God bless you! Emmanuel. Jesus is Lord! Happy Birthday!” – TB Joshua
