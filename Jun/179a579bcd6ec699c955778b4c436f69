The NEITI 2019 oil and gas report also made recommendations on how to improve transparency and accountability in the sector. Some of the recommendations were that the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) should advice the NNPC to prepare its budget on a gross basis by stating its gross revenue and costs. The report noted that the practice if adopted, would improve transparency and accountability in the NNPC’s transactions on behalf of the federation. The report also recommended that NNPC should carry-out detailed reconciliation on transportation revenues regularly as a mechanism for checks and balances. It also observed that entities are reporting crude losses higher than the fiscalised production and recommended that the DPR should take steps to reduce losses by the terminal operators. It also highlighted the outstanding liabilities by companies as of 2019 year end and advised the respective government agencies to recover the debts. This is the 12th cycle of independent oil and gas industry audit exercise by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) in line with the NEITI Act 2007 and Nigeria’s obligation to the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The report reconciled payments from ninety-eight (98) entities. They include eighty-eight (88) oil and gas companies, nine government agencies and the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG).
