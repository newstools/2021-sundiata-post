UMUAHIA – Residents of Bende road in Umuahia, capital of Abia State, woke up on Tuesday morning to a sight of a fetish object in front of the Police Area Command. A visit to the scene revealed the object placed in the area where human and vehicular movements have been restricted. Some residents, who discussed in hushed tones, said it was placed there to protect security operatives from a series of attacks. Abia is one of the states where gunmen have staged multiple attacks. Officers have been killed and many police stations set ablaze in recent times. Efforts made to get the reaction of SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, Police Public Relations Officer in the state, on the development did not yield results as he neither answered calls nor responded to messages sent to him.  (Daily Trust) OWERRI - Police and Nigerian Army operatives have shot dead a 48-year-old father of two, Ifeanyi Obi, who was attending a funeral in Owerri, Imo State, according to SaharaReporters.
