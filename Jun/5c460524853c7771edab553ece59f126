The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), has insisted that state governors complaining of herdmen attacks in their states should find a lasting solution to the problem.  The President said this in an exclusive interview with Arise TV aired on Thursday while answering a question on state police. He said that recently, two South-West governors visited him to complain about herdsmen encroaching on farmers’ lands in their regions. “You know these people more than I do, and you are democratically elected to protect your people. Don’t sit idly expecting me to do everything, take action,” he asserted.  Source
