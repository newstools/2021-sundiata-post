Nigerian actor and skit maker, Nosa Rex, has disclosed how he handles pressure from female fans.  In an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, “I am a married man, so I always look for ways to run (when I get funny requests from female fans). Women would always come and make some funny statements. But, I have been handling them well. As a married man, I am staying focused; no distractions.” Rex also stated that he started making comedy skits because he wanted to show his funny side.  Source
