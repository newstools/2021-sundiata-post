The Ondo State High Court sitting in Olokuta Akure, Ondo State, on Monday did not grant bail to Kemisola Ogunniyi, one of the EndSARS protesters , who delivered baby in prison.  Ogunniyi was among those who were arrested and standing trial for allegedly vandalising property during the EndSARS protest which took place in Akure, the state capital, last year. The 18-year-old lady gave birth to a baby boy in the prison last Wednesday. The state government has expressed its readiness to secure the bail of the defendant. However, the matter did not come up in on Monday as the counsel for the defendant stated that the judge, Justice Omolara Adejumo, said she was not aware of the bail application made by the counsel. The defendant’s counsel, Tope Temokun, explained that, he sought the audience with the judge and he was told that the bail application would be heard on Tuesday. The state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Charles Titiloye, said, “There are procedures for all court matters. It was a court order that put the person in the custody and the court order has to be followed in securing her bail. So Tuesday is not too late. We have to follow the court procedure.”  Source Again Suswam Arraigned On Fresh Corruption Charges, Gets N250m Bail Each In "Top Stories" By Edith Nwapi Abuja - An FCT High Court Maitama on Monday admitted Philomins Chieshe, charged with alleged “missing”  N35 million belonging to the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to bail in the sum of N20 million.
