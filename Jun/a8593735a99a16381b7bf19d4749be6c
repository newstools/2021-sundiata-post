An ex-presidential aide, Reno Omokri has called on people to stop believing that hard work brings wealth.  According to him, smart work and not hard work brings wealth.  Making a reference to a bible verse, Reno Omokri stated that poverty should motivate the need to work smart to evade the life of insufficient resources. “Hard work does not bring wealth. That is a myth the upper class sold the working class to suppress them. So, what brings wealth? Smart work, not hard work. The smarter you work, the wealthier you get. The harder you work, the unhealthier you get. Even Scripture says “If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but skill will bring success”-Ecclesiastes 10:10. So, even if you are poor and people mock you over your poverty, don’t feel bad. Instead, let their mockery motivate you to work smart and succeed, until you get to the point where you are so successful that your workers earn more than your mockers!” he wrote.
