The Shepherd Superintendent of the Household of God Church, Rev. Chris Okotie, on Tuesday morning, shared a cryptic post on his Facebook page in which he referenced a certain ”wizard of Endor” who assumed the title of ”Emmanuel”.  The clergyman in his post said the wizard who assumed the title of Emmanuel had been consumed by divine indignation. His post came on the heels of the death of a controversial pastor, T.B. Joshua, who was known for using the name ”Emmanuel” in his church. Although Okotie did not mention T.B. Joshua expressly and directly, the inference remains unmistakable. The Facebook Post has elicited a rash of comments which were largely critical of Rev Okotie.
