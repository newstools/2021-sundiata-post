A National Diploma 2 of the Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, Imo State has spent weeks in police detention after being accused of belonging to the Eastern Security Network.  According to Sahara Reporters, Emediong Davis was among those arrested after a police raid on May 13. Davis, a student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, also does art works for people and was on his way to deliver an artwork to a client when he and his friend were rounded up. SaharaReporters gathered that the families of the two boys were searching for them after the police took him away and ordered their phones switched off. Weeks later, Davis‚Äôs family members said they saw him on the state television being paraded as an ESN suspect. A Twitter user, @Truthfully83, brought the matter to the Police Complaint Response Unit who promised to investigate the incident. He said, ‚ÄúEMEDIONG DAVIS is an ND 2 student of Fed Poly Nekede. He returned home on the 12/5/21, due to the prolonged strike of (ASUP) but was KIDNAPPED by the @PoliceNG on the 13/5/21. Unknown to his family, an incident which I can describe as one of the worst forms of human rights violations. ‚ÄúDavis, who is studying Electrical Electronics Engineering, with Reg.

He was conveyed in a motorcycle, by a friend, Saturday Okon Job, who accompanied him. ‚ÄúThey both disappeared into thin air, without any trace. Their phones were switched off, & their lines went dead. They were both missing for days. The families of Emediong Davis, & Saturday Okon Job, went all over Akwa Ibom state, searching for the two young men. But got no hope. ‚ÄúBoth families who reside in Ekot Ekpene, went to different hospitals, mortuaries, @PoliceNG stations around Akwa Ibom state, in search of their loved ones. They even went to the @PoliceNGHeadquarters at (Ikot Akpan Abia) but were told that they weren‚Äôt there. ‚Äú@aksgovt, six says after a fruitless search, the family saw this newspaper publication, where @PoliceNG had arrested Emediong Davis and Saturday Okon Job on their way to Obot Akara to deliver the art work, and branded them members of IPOB/ESN, that they raided in a camp.‚Äù On Monday, SaharaReporters had reported that the May 30 Biafran Remembrance Day dug out the profiles of some of the residents who were raided by the police and the army, labelled and paraded as belonging to IPOB or its militant arm, the Eastern Security Network.
