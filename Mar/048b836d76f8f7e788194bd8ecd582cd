A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Thursday declared Ifeanyi Ararume as winner of the December 5, 2020 Imo North Senatorial District by-election.  Justice Taiwo, in a judgment, held that Ararume remained the authentic candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election as at today and should be declared winner of the election. The judge also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue a Certificate of Return to Ararume within 72 hours from the delivery of the judgment for him to be formally inaugurated by the Senate President.
