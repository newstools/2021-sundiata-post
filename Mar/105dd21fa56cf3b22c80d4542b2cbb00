Dele Momodu, a media personality, has reacted as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) issued a directive for bank employees to declare their assets in accordance with the bank employees declaration of assets act.  EFCC Chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa who gave the directive while speaking with journalists after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday March 16, also gave a June 1 deadline for workers to comply with the directive. Reacting to this, Momodu asked if the country is currently under a military regime. He also pointed out that banks belong largely to the private sector and declaration of assets should start with government agencies and politicians. He Tweeted; “Are we in a military regime? Why not start with government agencies and politicians? Banks belong largely to the private sector… “EFCC orders bank workers to declare assets, sets June 1 deadline…” Source
