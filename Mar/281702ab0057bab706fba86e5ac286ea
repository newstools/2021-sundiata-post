Prof Yemi Osinbajo, the Vice-President has stated that if Nigeria splits, people may need visas to travel to Kano.  He made this known while advising those calling for Nigeria to break up. According to SaharaReporters, Osinbajo said this while delivering his speech virtually at the 12th Bola Tinubu Colloquium in commemoration of Tinubu’s 69th birthday in Kano.
