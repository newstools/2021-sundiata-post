Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has declared he doesn’t give a hoot about losing re-election in 2023.  Makinde, who failed in his governorship bids in 2007, 2011 and 2015, said: “If the people of Oyo State ask me to leave the office as governor today, I won’t hesitate to leave the office because I go to office daily with my bag.”  He spoke at the pan-Yoruba Congress at Mapo Hall, Ibadan declaring he has no godfather. According to him: “Let me tell you here today. I don’t have a political father. It was God who made me governor and not human being. I fear only God and not any human. No matter how powerful a man is, I cannot fear him. “I contested election in 2007, 2011 and 2015 but failed and when it is time for God to make me a governor, he made me. “If the people of the state decided that they don’t want me again, I will only take my bag and leave because I don’t have a pin in the office.” Source To the chagrin of all, the headlines hit the airwaves on Tuesday November 12, 2019 reading- “Confusion in Oyo over Appeal Court ruling.” It was a shock find for millions of residents and indigenes of Oyo State and observers of activities in the Pacesetter State since the close of the… In "Opinion" Says Oyinlola remains a strong pillar we want in PDP By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) - Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, on Monday extolled the virtues of a former Governor of Osun State and former National Secretary of party, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, noting that the former Governor remained… In "News" IBADAN (SundiataPost) - Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, has described the late industrialist and successful entrepreneur, Chief Bode Akindele, as a legend and role model for development.Governor Makinde, who stated this while speaking at the burial ceremony of the late Business mogul, said that Akindele will live forever because of… In "News"
