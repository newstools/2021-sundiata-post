Nigeria’s total public debt grew by ₦692 billion between September and December 2020. The total debt stock stands at N32.915 trillion. The Debt Management Office (DMO), in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, said the figure is as at December 31, 2020. This figure the DMO said: “Include the Debt Stock of the Federal and State Governments, as well as, the Federal Capital Territory”. As of the third quarter of 2020, Nigeria’s total debt stock was put at ₦32.223 trillion. Trying to minimise the increase in the total debt stock of the nation, the DMO noted Nigeria’s borrowings have been on the decline until 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic struck. According to the DMO: “After Nigeria exited recession in 2017, the level of New Borrowing at the Federal Level as shown in the Annual Appropriation Acts, had been declining as part of the Government’s measures to moderate the rate of Growth in the Public Debt Stock in order to ensure debt sustainability”. “New Borrowing to part finance budget deficits had declined steadily from N2.36 trillion in 2017 to N2.01 trillion in 2018, N1.61 trillion in 2019 and N1.59 trillion in the first 2020 Appropriation Act. “This trend was reversed in 2020 due to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic as New Borrowing in the revised 2020 Appropriation Act was N4.20 Trillion”. The DMO states “apart from the new domestic borrowing of N2.3 trillion, the other new borrowings were concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund (USD3.34 Billion) and other multilateral and bilateral lenders”. This incremental borrowing to part-finance the 2020 Budget and the additional issuance of Promissory Notes to settle some arrears of the Federal Government of Nigeria the DMO said: “contributed to the increase in Public Debt Stock. New Domestic Borrowings by State Governments also contributed to the growth in the Public Debt Stock”.
