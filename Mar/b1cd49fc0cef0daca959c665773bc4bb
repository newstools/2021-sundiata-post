Some onion farmers and marketers in Kano State are lamenting over the effect of the blockade of food items to the southern part of the country. To protest the recent attacks on traders in some South West States, the The Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria (AUFCDN) had embarked on a strike. This led to increase in price of food commodities in the south but in the north, the prices are plummeting. On Tuesday, Daily Trust visited the Gun-Dutse Onion Market in Dawakin Kudu Local Government Area of Kano State to see how the traders are coping with the strike. Some of them said before the protest, they usually transport a minimum of 20 trucks to the southern part of the country on a daily basis but the strike has affected them badly The largest bag of onion, which sold at N35,000 few weeks ago and as high as N70,000 during the onion scarcity last year, is now being sold for N7,000. Here are pictures of some of the trades at the market.
