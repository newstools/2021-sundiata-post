Nigerians living in Lagos state can now get vaccinated against the dreaded coronavirus following the release of list of 88 health centres selected to provide vaccination against COVID-19.  The Lagos State Government released the list of 88 health facilities, including military and police hospitals on Tuesday. In a statement on Tuesday, the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, said vaccination can only be obtained at any of the 88 accredited facilities listed. “Vaccination outside of these locations in Lagos State is highly prohibited and will attract heavy sanctions through our regulatory agencies,” he said. The commissioner said the vaccination will be conducted in four phases. While phase 1 is for healthcare workers, COVID-19 response team, ports of entry staff (air, land, and seaports), laboratory network, judiciary, military, police, other security agencies, petrol station workers, teachers, press and other frontline workers; phase two is for people aged 50 years and above as well as those living with co-morbidities who are between 18-49 years of age. Phase three is for people in the LGAs with the highest burden of disease and those who missed phases 1 and 2 and phase 4 for other eligible populations. Of this first tranche of 3.92 million doses allocated to Nigeria, Lagos State received 507,742 doses of the vaccine in the early hours of Tuesday, March 9, 2021, and has commenced its first phase of distribution. How to register He explained that a combined approach will be utilised for the registration for those that qualify for COVID-19 vaccination in phase1: Electronic self-Registration of Health Care Workers and other frontline workers using a dedicated URL. Each enrollee is expected to pre-register on https://www.nphcdaict.com.ng or https://www.vaccination.gov.ng to fill the form with their qualifying verifiable details, preferred vaccination site, date, and time. A vaccination ID will be generated, and this should be taken to the chosen health facility along with a means of ID. A confirmation text message and email will be sent to each enrollee after successfully registering for the vaccination. Assisted electronic registration of Health Care and essential workers who are unable to complete self-registration due to lack of android devices, poor network, or not being tech-savvy. “Although the registration portal is open to the public, ONLY eligible participants within phase 1 should register for the vaccination now. More information on the vaccination of other participants in phases 2 to 4 will be communicated subsequently,” he added. How to report side effects he explained that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has been declared safe by the World Health Organization, but most vaccines have some common side effects, which are not unique to the COVID-19 vaccine and which typically only last for 24 to 48 hours. According to him, some of these common adverse events that could be experienced include: Pain or tenderness at the injection site, tiredness, chills, joint pains, headache, fever, muscle pain and nausea. He said, “Should any of these side effects become problematic, kindly call the number of the LGA Disease Surveillance Notification Officer—provided at the back of the COVID-19 vaccination card—for guidance, and/or return to the same health facility for further investigations and treatment. “All vaccinated persons are also advised to download the MED SAFETY app monitored by NAFDAC. The app can be downloaded on the iOS Store or Google Play store, and can be used to report any untoward event experienced after vaccination and/or any other Adverse Drug Reactions experienced with the use of concomitant drugs.” List Of 88 Vaccination Sites In 20 Local Government Areas (LGAs) S/N LGAs Wards Facility1 Agege KEKE Sango PHC2 Agege ORILE Powerline phc3 Ajeromi/Ifelodun OLUWA/AKERE Akere PHC4 Ajeromi/Ifelodun OWOYEMI LAYENI PHC5 Ajeromi OWOYEMI Signals Operation Command Clinic6 Ajeromi ALAYABIAGBA Obisesan Naval Medical Centre7 Ajeromi/Ifelodun Awodiora Ajeromi GH8 Alimosho Alabata Akowonjo PHC9 Alimosho ALAGBADO/ALAKUKO AGBADO PHC10 Alimosho IDIMU Helen Aderonke PHC11 Alimosho IPAJA Ipaja phc12 Alimosho ISHERI-OLOFIN Isheri Olofin PHC13 Alimosho OKUNOLA Rauf Aregbesola phc14 Alimosho OMITUNTUN-OLORI Ipinlerere PHC15 Alimosho IGANDO Alimosho GH16 Alimosho GowonEstate NIGERIAN NAVY SICKBAY17 Alimosho Oguntade/Bameke NAF Medical Centre Shasha18 Amuwo Odofin ADO SOBA BAT PHC19 Amuwo Odofin AGBOJU &ENVIRON Agboju phc20 Amuwo Odofin ORIRE Festac PHC21 Amuwo KIRIKIRI & ENVIRON NIGERIAN NAVY REFERENCE HOSPITAL22 Apapa GASKIYA Olojowon Primary Health Centre23 Apapa IJORA Ijora oloye phc24 APAPA APAPA CFO MRS MILITARY HOSPITAL25 Badagry APA APA PHC26 Badagry IWORO-GBANKO Ilado phc27 BADAGRY APA NAF Mother & Child Hosp28 Epe AGBOWA I Agbowa PHC29 Epe BADO/EBOLE/ETITA/IBERIKODO Epe phc30 Epe AGBOWA Agbowa GH31 Eti Osa 1004/ABOYADE Oriyanrin PHC32 Eti Osa BADORE/LANGBASA Badore phc33 Eti Osa IGBO-EFON/MAIYEGUN Igbo efon phc34 Eti Osa IJEH/DOLPHIN ESTATE Ikoyi PHC35 Eti Osa IKATE/LEKKI IKATE PHC36 Eti Osa SANGOTEDO SANGOTEDO PHC37 Eti Osa OKUNMOPO/OGOMBO MCC38 Eti-Osa Falomo Police Hospital39 Eti-Osa VI2 65 Batallion MRS Hospital40 Ibeju Lekki IBEJU I IBEJU PHC41 Ibeju Lekki ORIMEDU I Akodo GH42 Ifako/Ijaye ALAGBADO/KOLLINTON Agbado Kola PHC43 Ifako/Ijaye IFAKO/COKER Ifako Primary Health Centre44 Ifako/Ijaye IFAKO/COKER Ifako GH45 Ikeja OJODU OJODU PHC46 Ikeja ONILEKERE ONILEKERE PHC47 Ikeja OREGUN Oregun PHC48 Ikeja G.R.A.
