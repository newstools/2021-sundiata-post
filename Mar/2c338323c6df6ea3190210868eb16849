Chioma Nwadike, a young Nigerian lady has come ou to dismiss the reports attributing her to be the new wife of Lamidi Adeyemi, Alaafin of Oyo.  The monarch had recently set tongues wagging on social media after he stepped out with Chioma Adeyemi, his new wife, for the installation of Tomori Williams, a real estate mogul, as the Aare Onikoyi of Yorubaland in Ibadan. Shortly after the event that happened last weekend, rumours had swirled on social media claiming that Nwadike was the lady who got married to the traditional ruler.  The reports also claimed that Nwadike, who shares the same name with Alaafin’s new wife, dumped her husband to marry the 82-year-old.But in a Twitter thread on Saturday, Nwadike, a banker cum entrepreneur, asked the public to disregard such reports, noting that such were aimed at smearing her image. The writer explained that the person she was said to have dumped in the now-viral photos is her estranged husband from a failed marriage, adding that the divorce proceeding is still ongoing in court. Nwadike added that since the rumours went viral, she has been subjected to ridicule on Facebook — a development which made her delete her account. “The person in the picture is my estranged husband from a failed marriage, the aftermath of which, I am still suffering till today. These past few months have been a turbulent ride for me, evident by this current false news and defamatory posts,” she wrote. “Regrettably, these false and rather demeaning publications have now perturbed and created an unnecessarily, traumatic environment amongst my family, friends and colleagues who found it very hard to harbor the believe that I purportedly jilted my estranged husband in order to marry the Alaafin of Oyo.” DISCLAIMER!!! My name is Chioma Nwadike, yesterday, being the 12th day of march 2021, my attention was drawn to online media posts making rounds of my “marriage” allegedly to the Alaafin of Oyo as his 13th wife. — Omalicha👑 (@Omalicha_adamma) March 13, 2021 Nwadike wondered why anyone would single her out for such insult amid her battle with the “emotional and painful rigours” of her “messy divorce” process from her estranged husband. “It is rather unfathomable as to why I am being singled out to be diminished in the eyes of Nigerians even whilst still going through the emotional and painful rigors of an extremely messy divorce proceeding, which is still pending in court and wherein my estranged husband and his Lawyers have applied every dilatory tactic to stall the conclusion of the case for reasons I wouldn’t want to state now,” she continued. “Regrettably, these false and rather demeaning publications have now perturbed and created an unnecessarily traumatic environment amongst my family, friends and colleagues who found it very hard to harbor the belief that I purportedly jilted my estranged husband in order to marry the Alaafin of Oyo.”  Source Controversial Nigerian journalist,, Kemi Olunloyo has revealed that Davido’s fiancee, Chioma Rowland has moved out of his house.
