Bovi, the Popular Nigerian comedian, has called out Nollywood actor and director, Niyi Akinmolayan on social media.  Bovi called the director out, describing him as a clout chaser for promoting his movie after he deliberately refused to identify with the project since it came out. Recall the comedian/actor recently released his comedy movie, ‘My Village People’ which was directed by Akinmolayan. But in a lengthy post on Saturday, Bovi accused the director of attempting to shut down his set during their shoot following a disagreement about the movie script. After the said disagreement, Bovi claimed the approach to making the movie became ‘lame’ and ‘deliberately mediocre.’ He went on to explain how he was told to ignore Akinmolayan and focus on completing the project. The comedian also slammed Akinmolayan for just coming out to identify with the movie because the project is doing ‘favorably well.’ Read his full post below:
