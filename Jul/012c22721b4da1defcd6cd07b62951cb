 A former Secretary to Oyo State Government, Alhaji Waheed Olajide, on Friday, said that adoption of the Presidential system of government in Nigeria was a major factor impeding good governance.In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan, Olajide said that the numerous political appointees that characterise the system does not ensure robust contributions to policy formulations.According to him, the political appointees are more often concerned with retaining their appointments than assisting to ensure good governance.Olajide, a former Managing Director of University Press Plc, served as SSG during the first term of late Gov. Abiola Ajimobi’s administration.“It is my hope that when we have the opportunity in future to discuss restructuring of the country, the disadvantage of the presidential system of government would be adequately addressed,” he said.Olajide also recommended the scrapping of the office of the first lady at both the Federal and state levels, saying the office was another hindrance to good governance.He said that the office had become so powerful, and sometimes negatively influenced some of the decisions already taken by the cabinet.The former Secretary to the Oyo State Government also advised that civil servants should be insulated from the intrigues of politicians to enable them carry out their duties effectively and efficiently to the best of their abilities“The professional job of the civil service is to brief the politician on the road leading to good returns and the road leading to the ditch.“The civil service can be assisted by ensuring the independence of the civil service commission and protecting the office of the Head of Service from the danger of arbitrary sack,” he said.Olajide suggested that the position of permanent secretary should no longer be based on political considerations to ensure virility of service. He accused most governors and commissioners of encouraging rumour peddlers, saying such would only destabilise their team.“Most of these rumours are often fabricated and tolerating rumour-mongering would only divide their teams.’’Olajide, the author of 187-page autobiography titled ‘This Child Must Not Die’, advised parents to ensure proper upbringing of their children and to also monitor the kind of friends their children keep.He said that the height a person could attain in life depended on the kind of friends they choose.“A lot of people have made it in life due to positive peer influence, while so many others have died prematurely as a result of negative peer influence.“It is expected of parents not to close their eyes to the kind of friends theirs children move with. There is always a tide in the affairs of men which when exploited properly will eventually lead to fortune,” he said. (NAN) MAIDUGURI - Gov.
