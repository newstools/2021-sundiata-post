 Iran rejected as “ridiculous and baseless” the United States’ claim of Tehran’s involvement in plotting to kidnap a New York journalist and human rights activist. The journalist was critical of the Islamic Republic, Iranian state media reported on Wednesday. “This new claim by the U.S. government … is so baseless and ridiculous that it is not really worth answering,’’ said Foreign Ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh.
