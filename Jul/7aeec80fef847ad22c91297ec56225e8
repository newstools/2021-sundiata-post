A youghurt seller, identified simply as Jumoke, has been killed by bullets reportedly fired by a security operative dispersing Yoruba Nation agitators at Ojota, Lagos State. A news flash by Saturday PUNCH said that “bullets had severed the stomach of the girl, said to be 14 years”. “She was reportedly displaying drinks at a shop when the bullet hit her,” the report said, adding: “Her body has been covered with a piece of cloth as crowd gathered at the spot.” News Express had earlier reported how a combined team of heavily armed security operatives forcefully disarmed the peaceful protesters who gathered in defiance of warnings by both the Lagos State Government and the Nigeria Police Force.
