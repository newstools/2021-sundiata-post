In an interview with an NTA News correspondent, Chidinma revealed that they met at a party through Usifo’s friend who was dating her friend. According to her, it was also the first time they slept together. The UNILAG student who disclosed that they were both high when they got into a fight at the shortlet apartment they lodged, said she tied his hands while he was sleeping and stabbed him repeatedly before stealing his money “which was what she wanted”.
