 Coronavirus numbers continue to rise in Tokyo three weeks ahead of the start of the Olympics, with 716 infections announced on Saturday over the past 24 hours. Broadcasters NHK quoted a city council member as saying that the number of infections is rising steadily again and that the majority of the cases concern young people in their 20s. Infections have been on the rise again for the past fortnight compared to the previous week’s numbers, with the Saturday figure 182 more than a week ago. Tokyo and other regions ended a state of emergency on June 20 but a quasi state of emergency remains in place at least until July 11. The Olympics run July 23 to Aug. 8 amid fears they could become a super-spreader event, and a majority of Japanese oppose the staging of the Games in the current situation. But Japan’s government, local organisers and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have pledged safe games amid a tight hygiene concept for everyone involved. Up to 10,000 fans or 50 per cent venue capacity are to be allowed to attend events. But it is also not out of the question the Games will be behind closed doors after all. Foreign fans are not allowed in. (NAN)
